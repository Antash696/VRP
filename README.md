This is an aplication/framework (will see how this gonna work out) for solving capacitated vehicle routing problem.

For now the working part are only the tests ;)
Current funcionality:
	importing from TSPlib (euclides 2d only) format,
	greedy selection of nodes

Future:
	branch and bound algorithm
	tabu search
	parallelisation
	profiling
	drawing
	actually working app!

It's possible that all will be rewritten to Cython (yup - Python's GIL...)
This is a student project so the main part is to check the efectiveness of the algorithms, although I'm trying to write it extensible for future fun.
AFTER I get my grade this will go on with MIT license I think.
