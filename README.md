This is an app for solving capacitated vehicle routing problem.

It begun as an academic project for my studies, however after few years I decided to
rewrite it and add some functionalities seeing that it has gathered some attention.

So whoever you are, if you're looking for a well-written CVRP implementation in Python, then look no further!

Old release is available as a **tag**, this is a *work in progress* and some stuff still has not been rewritten so you might want to check if it has been already implemented there, but did not make here yet.

Current functionality:
* Importing TSPLIB euc2d format
* All wrapped in a simple CLI interface

In the near future:
* Branch and Bound algorithm
* TabuSearch based algorithm
* visualization of the solutions
* more heuristics
